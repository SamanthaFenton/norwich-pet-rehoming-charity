## Norwich Pet Rehoming Charity  

Project created by Samantha Fenton in July 2023.  

Description  

I have been given 1x week to create a working website using html, css and JavaScript.  I have chosen to create and design a website for a local animal charity, named 'Norpet'.  The project is to advertise and display local pets that are both available for adoption and for local residents to advertise their animals in need of rehoming.  

The website will have an intro page where the user will be greeted using JavaScript, and then the website will provide instructions to the user on how to proceed, whereby the user must click on a theme prior to entering the site, using JavaScript and LocalStorage.  This selection will determine the theme of the website.  

The user will proceed to a 'Home' page providing website information, a brief summary of the website content and a website navigation toolbar.  

There will be an 'About Us' page with navigation links whereby the user will be provided with company information;   
  -"What we do" - paragraph of text,   
  -"Where we are" - image of location,   
  -"When it was created and why"- paragraph of text,   
  -"What donations are spent on" - paragraph of text etc.  

There will be an 'Adoption' page (with navigation links) whereby the animals ready for adoption will be listed (hopefully via an image) whereby the user can click on the image and it displays the full animal profile of the animal clicked on, with two buttons; click to adopt button which will take the user to the contact us page and a click to go back button returning the user to the main adoption page.  Also on the adoption page there will link to another html page 'Rehoming' where the user will be taken to a form to add a new animal for rehoming (which does not clear on refresh but on submit); whereby the user registers their details with the company and enters their animals details and create a new pet profile, which hopefully will display on the 'Adoption' page.  The Adoption page will ideally contain the following;
  -Name.  
  -Age.  
  -Can be in a home with children.  
  -Can be in a home with other animals.  
  -Has special needs.

I will create an object of new pet and use a construtor function to create incidents of new pets to be added to the page.

  The 'Rehoming' page (with navigation links) will contain a form to be submitted via click button asking the above information regarding the animal and contact information regarding the owner.  I will try to display the contents of this form, minus the owners information, on the adoption page.

Finally there will be a 'Contact Us' page with company contact information on it.

I aim to include a CSS animation and for it all to work with no bugs!
